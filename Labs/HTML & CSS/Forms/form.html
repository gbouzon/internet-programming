    questions: 

    1. can I do width = 100 without putting my value in between ""
        We can, but only with numbers. Using it ("") every time will avoid problems.
    3. can I put my <input> inside my label tags
        yes, it's more of a style choice. Depends on what you're trying to do.
    4. do I need to do a <br> every time I want to skip a line? What if I want to skip 50 lines? 50 <br> :gasps:
        With what we currently know, we would need to add hundreds of <br> tags. 
        When we learn CSS, we'll find a more efficient way of doing that.

	5. form action, method = "POST"
		POST hides sensitive information (like the username and password) as opposed to GET
