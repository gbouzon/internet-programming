player + dealer
player decides when to get additional cards
"draw a new card" or "hold" - two buttons
if total is above 21, dealer wins, game ends.
if total is less or equal to 21, player goes to dealer (when player decides to stop)

when player finishes, dealer's turn

dealer does not have a choice
whenever sum total of his cards is 16 or below, must draw an additional card
whenever sum total of his card is 17 or above, must stop.
total of above 21, counts as loss

aces 11 points AT ALL TIMES
face cards 10 points (king, queen, jack)
others -whatever number on the card (3 of diamonds - 3 points)

NOT ALLOWED TO MODIFY .HTML (use what's already there)

each player and dealer have two image elements (first two card at the beg. of the game)

when player draws a new card = third card (from game total)
add a third card element (javaScript not html, use script from lab 3)
same thing applies to the dealer

create functions having the defined names in the .html doc
javascript file is already added to the .html, name is game.js

cards are assigned randomly (use generateRandomNumber() method from lab 1)
ONLY ONE PLAYER AND ONE DEALER

every hand is a game.
when we start a new game (start a new hand), we reshuffle the deck, start from the beg., fresh 52 cards

img folder has ALL 52 cards as images, DO NOT CHANGE, MODIFY, MOVE.
not allowed to TOUCH ANYTHING IN THAT FOLDER pls and thank

names help create the images = return of randomNumberGenerator() method + "png" is the name of your image

DUPLICATE CARDS ARE NOT ALLOWED = remove the card from the deck (remove as an option from randomNumberGenerator())

SCORES MUST BE UPDATED dealerScore, playerScore sections.
update using id(playerScore, dealerScore) = add the card number to the existing number (beside row "Player:") - column in a table
once update is done, verify score. Once score is >=21, all buttons have to be disabled (not allowed to ask for a new card)
game is over so player should no longer be able to make decisions.

NO DATA PASSES FROM ONE GAME TO THE NEXT (AT THE BEG OF EACH GAME, ALL DATA FROM PREVIOUS GAMES ARE COMPLETELY ERASED)

BUTTONS

when the hold button is pressed, it automatically becomes the dealer's turn.
this only happens IF the player has not lost (dealer already won so there's no point in continuing the game)
as soon as the hold button is pressed, it must become disabled (player should not be able to re press hold button NOR to press draw button)

when dealer finishes his turn, no one has lost.
the game ends once dealer finishes his turn
then compare dealer's score with player's score to determine who has won
ADD "has won the game" to the player/dealer section
example: Player + "has won the game" OR dealer + "has won the game"
DO NOT REPLACE THE CONTENT, ADD TO THE CONTENT
highlight this in green = change background to green

DEALER DOES NOT HAVE CHOICES, HIS ACTIONS ARE PREDETERMINED. HE HAS TO DRAW IF IT'S 16 OR LESS AND CAN'T IF IT'S 17 OR MORE
- no buttons for dealer.

player keeps drawing until he decides to hold or until he loses (not a by turn game, the dealer and the player each get one turn).

DO NOT TOUCH CSS OR HTML OR ANY OTHER FOLDER THERE. ALL YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TOUCH IS GAME.JS

tips:
- do not create objects where none are needed.
- one object that stands out with a strong purpose for this game
