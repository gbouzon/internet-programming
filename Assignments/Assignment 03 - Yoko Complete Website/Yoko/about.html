          <p> 
            Japanese cuisine is one of our favorites. We like the delicacy of its preparation, its finesse and simplicity. 
            For that reason, we decided to start a business based on introducing to the world our own perspectives of how Japanese cuisine should be.
            Our business offers Japanese courses as well as catering services (please refer to the classes and catering tabs).
